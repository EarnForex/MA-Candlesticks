# MA Candlesticks

MA Candlesticks is a free custom indicator for MT4 and MT5 coded by EarnForex.com. It takes a moving average of a given period and type and applies to all four price modes - Open, High, Low, and Close - to then display as Japanese candles.

You can use this indicator as you do with a normal moving average, except that it offers a lot more information in a form that is still easy-to-read.
